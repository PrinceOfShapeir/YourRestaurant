This is an all in one transactionless ordering and menu builder app. The user can select items to add to their shopping cart, which can then be exported or passed along to the store owner. The store owner can also upload new images and menu items using the same interface. Although this example is a demonstration of a restaurant model, the app can be used for any categorical shopping catalogue.

What is Transactionless Ordering? 

    The majority of ordering apps tend to charge a percentage of transactions. This adds a barrier to entry in that the business needs to have sufficient infrastructure to facilitate those transactions. What we do is simply provide a way to furnish the order summary and contact information from the customer, at which point the store can use their existing infrastructure, phone, cash register, point of sale, etc. in order to confirm and complete the transaction.

    A store that fulfills a significant amount of online orders can see transaction costs add up. Under our transactionless model, store owners have complete flexibility. They can charge the customer the cash rate, and keep 100% of the proceeds thereby. This provides a tool for small and local businesses, some of which operate on a cash basis.
